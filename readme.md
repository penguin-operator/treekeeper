# `tools/`
This folder collects scripts that help you to build and run the project.
It contains these files:
- `env` sets the cool shell prompt and adds `tools` folder to `$PATH` variable so you can run commands without `tools/` prefix,
- `build` builds the project,
- `run` builds and runs the project,
- `help` displays help about available tools.
